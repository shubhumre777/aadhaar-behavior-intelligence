## 📌 Problem Statement

Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

Aadhaar systems process millions of enrolments and updates every month. Sudden spikes or unusual biometric activity may indicate:

- System overload  
- Policy-driven mass update campaigns  
- Infrastructure limitations  
- Security audits or data correction drives  

Manual monitoring at national scale is not feasible.

This project builds an **AI-based behavioural monitoring system** to automatically identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, and predictive indicators to support informed decision-making and system improvements.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design a data-driven intelligence system that:

- Detects abnormal biometric update behaviour using Machine Learning  
- Identifies high-risk districts and regions  
- Discovers temporal trends and behavioural shifts  
- Translates raw data into actionable geographic and policy insights  

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

Two official UIDAI datasets:

1. Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset  
2. Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset  

Each dataset was provided in multiple CSV chunks and merged during preprocessing.

## Key Columns Used:

- `date`
- `state`
- `district`
- `pincode`
- `demo_age_5_17`
- `demo_age_17_`
- `bio_age_5_17`
- `bio_age_17_`

---

## 🛠️ Data Pipeline

1. Merge multiple CSV files  
2. Clean invalid dates & missing values  
3. Monthly aggregation at district level  
4. Feature engineering  
5. Machine learning anomaly detection  
6. Risk scoring & classification  
7. Visualization via Streamlit dashboard

## 🧪 Feature Engineering (Predictive Indicators)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `demo_total` | Total demographic updates |
| `bio_total` | Total biometric updates |
| `bio_demo_ratio` | Behavioural indicator (biometric / demographic) |
| `risk_score` | ML-weighted anomaly severity |
| `risk_level` | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH |

These features enable early detection of abnormal behavioural patterns.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

**Isolation Forest** (unsupervised anomaly detection)

Why Isolation Forest?

- Works well on large-scale numeric data  
- Detects rare abnormal behaviour  
- No labeled data required  
- Scalable for national datasets  

Output:

- `anomaly_flag` → normal or abnormal  
- Risk score per district-month  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Major nationwide biometric anomaly spike detected in **January 2025**
- ~800 districts showed abnormal behaviour in the same month
- Certain districts repeatedly exhibit extremely high biometric-to-demographic ratios
- Multiple states show persistent high-risk behaviour patterns

---

## 🗺️ Geographic Intelligence

The system visualizes biometric risk using a point-based geo map:

- Each point represents a state  
- Size & color represent biometric risk intensity  
- Enables quick identification of national stress hotspots  

---

## 🧭 Decision Support Framework

| Risk Level | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| LOW | Normal behaviour | Routine monitoring |
| MEDIUM | Moderate anomaly | Infrastructure review |
| HIGH | Severe anomaly | Immediate investigation & resource allocation |
